25,31-41 A crossed out word. The line organization becomes briefly
confused soon after.

28,62 The letters for 'What could' get bunched up here. The pound sign
should be replaced with 'ha'.

30,48 Maybe an 'o'.

31,24 The letters in 'all' get bunched up here. The pound sign should
be replaced with 'll'.

33,4 Could be a crossed out 'n'.

38,10 A hand-written forward slash that spans 38,10;39,9;40,8.

81,0 There is some type of double slash with a horizonal line on top
here ans something that may or may not be a quote mark.

84,62 There is a hand-written forward slash here.

90,39 It is clearly a 't' but there is something going on above it
that is unclear. It almost looks like an accent mark.

slightly below.

110,48 There is a dot above.

110,49 It looks almost like an 'l' above.

116,66 This is probably just what I've been typing as '\' but as a
hand-written correction.

143,40 There is an accent mark above the schwa.

144,67 There is an 'x' here above the base line, like it is a
superscript.

is schwa 'm'.
