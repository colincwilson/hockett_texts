I am using a custom notation to type up these texts using only ASCII
letters.

| Hockett                           | Typed Text |
| ' (non-quote separator character) | \          |
| ·                                 | +          |
| č                                 | _          |
| š                                 | $          |
| ə                                 | @          |
| ʔ                                 | =          |

Obviously, all of the above can be replace with a simple find and
replace.

Things that are crossed out or that do not correspond to an easy to
interpret character will be written '#'. These may have a note in the
notes section, listed by line and column number.
