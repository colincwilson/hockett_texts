* Charles Hockett's Potawatomi Texts

These text files are ASCII text versions of Charles Hockett's typed
transcriptions of Potawatomi fieldwork. They are from a collection
that contains Hockett’s files from field research he conducted among
the Potawatomi for his PhD dissertation.

I am working from copies of scans produced by Tammy L. Goss before the
materials were archived at the Smithsonian. Her file naming
conventions were retained.

An effort was made to preserve the original formatting so that the
text files are organized roughly like the typed pages.

** Notation used in these texts

I am using a custom notation to type up these texts using only ASCII
letters.

| Hockett                           | Typed Text |
| ' (non-quote separator character) | \          |
| ·                                 | +          |
| č                                 | _          |
| š                                 | $          |
| ə                                 | @          |
| ʔ                                 | =          |

These do not correspond to any previous notation used and were chosen
entirely for ease of typing and the fact that they do not conflict
with any characters used in English portions of the Hockett texts.

The included [[file:Makefile][Makefile]] can convert these to appropriate UTF8 unicode if
you run:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
make unicode
#+END_SRC

** Additional notes related to typing process

Things that are crossed out or that do not correspond to an easy to
interpret character will be written '#'. These will have a note in the
notes.org file. They will be listed by line and column number.

Additional notes that do not correspond to '#' in the typed text can
also be found in the [[file:notes.org][notes.org]] file with the same line and column
number convention.

Here is an example:

#+BEGIN_SRC orgmode
 ** DONE CraneBoyTranscriptionTyped
   CLOSED: [2014-12-19 Fri 03:36]

 12,39 Looks like a handwriten dash but curved.

 25,31-41 A crossed out word. The line organization becomes briefly
 confused soon after.
#+END_SRC

The section of notes will be headed by a line that begins with two '*'
symbols. This will be followed by the status, either 'DONE' or
'TODO'. If it is 'DONE' the line below will show when it was
finished. Below this you can see two example notes. The first has
simple coordinates in the form 'line,column'. The second has more
complex coordinates for a note that corresponds to some section of the
text that spans multiple columns.

It is problematic that it is not clear from simply looking at the text
whether there is necessarily a note at a particular point. A future
HTML version will combine the text with the notes.

Note that [[file:notes.org][notes.org]] is an emacs org mode file. Some of the header text
will not be visible unless you view the source.

** Original notes on scanned texts

The files in the 'texts' subdirectory are derived from scans produced
by Tammy L. Goss. She provided some notes on the files in two MS Word
files. I have reproduced the content of those original notes here.

*** Goss Document 1: Notes on Hockett Scans

The original file name was 'TGNotes on Hockett Scans.docx'.

The following preceded the text and was also duplicated at the end of
the notes: 

  - Tammy L. Goss
  - Notes on Hockett Scans: Typed Potawatomi Stories
  - Last Update: Wednesday, November 3, 2010

The following text in the subsections 'Filenames are:' and 'NOTES:'
has been altered only in minor formatting changes but is otherwise as
written by Tammy L. Goss.

**** Filenames are:

  - CraneBoyTranscription
  - PotawatomiAS_32-34
  - PotawatomiStory2pages
  - PotawatomiTextJA_AS_pp1-28

All individual files have been combined in Adobe PDF.  All individual
files are still saved individually; in RAW and JPEG format.

**** NOTES:

  - CraneBoyTranscription :: 8 pages of typed transcription that were
       stapled together
  - PotawatomiAS_32-24 :: 3 pages with handwritten (in pencil) page
       numbers written in the upper right corner.  They may be have
       been part of the packet that makes up file
       PotawatomiTextJA_AS_pp1-28, but the PotawatomiAS_32-24 pages
       were stapled together and stored separately from
       PotawatomiTextJA_AS_pp1-28 in Hockett’s files, so therefore I
       cannot assume that they are from the same sequential numbering.
  - PotawatomiStory2pages :: These are two vellum, typed pages of
       Potawatomi text.  They were stored next to the papers I have
       named PotawatomiAS_32-24, but were not included in the stapled
       group.  All of the papers were in a folder marked Potawatomi in
       Hockett’s handwriting so it is safe to assume, unless proven
       otherwise, that these two pages are indeed Potawatomi.
  - PotawatomiTextJA_AS_pp1-28 ::  These pages were double-stapled on
       the left-hand side (see first image) and comprise several
       Potawatomi texts.  They were dictated to Hockett by JA (unknown
       as to who this is) and AS (Alice Spear).  Pages are numbered in
       pencil in the upper right hand corner of each page.  Pages
       17-22 were not included in the packet and I have not come
       across them in other boxes yet.

  - NOTE: For some reason when I converted the images to PDF, some of
    the pages appear on the screen as normal or larger than normal
    size and others smaller than normal.  I have tried to fix this but
    I have not found a way to do this yet.  For now, you can use the
    magnifying lens to zoom in and out of the pages to make them more
    readable.

*** Goss Document 2: File naming conventions for typed handwritten pairings

The original file name was
FileNamingConventionsForTyped_HandwrittenPairings.docx

It contained the following tables.
