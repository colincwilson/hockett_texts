The typed portion of this is a duplicate of
[[TypedASJuly13_1937_1_LL2_1-2_4]]. I will probably just remove this file
at some point but I will wait since this file name does correspond to
a scanned file name.

The scanned file does not contain any handwritten transcriptions.

has become ambiguous. I think it is an 's'.

59,0 This is the beginning of a page with a handwritten '14' in the
top right corner.

same spot but I think it is supposed to be a 'k'.

show that the vowel is nasal.

83,32 There looks to be something over typed here but I'm pretty sure
it is supposed to be a 'k'.

character be a 'k' rather than some other typo.

character be a 'p' rather than some other typo.

52,54 There is an unrecognizable mark here, kind of like an grave
accent mark over nothing. Maybe it is a glottal stop?
