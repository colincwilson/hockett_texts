show that the vowel is nasal.

83,32 There looks to be something over typed here but I'm pretty sure
it is supposed to be a 'k'.

91,31 There is a handwritten correction. I think it is to make the
character be a 'k' rather than some other typo.

91,33 There is a handwritten correction. I think it is to make the

91,67 This vowel is ambiguous looking but I think it is an 'o'.

quality is horrible, especially in the first lines. 

This text contains the letter 'j', which most of the other texts do
not. This 'j' obviously corresponds to 'y' in the other texts and so
will be typed as 'y' in this version.
